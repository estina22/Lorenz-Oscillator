The LORENZ ATTRACTOR is part of a dynamical system and Chaos theory. A dynamical system moves to and stays near a certain pointThe LORENZ ATTRACTOR is part of a dynamical system and Chaos theory. A dynamical system moves to and stays near a certain point, called an attractor. An attractor could also be a set of points.
The Lorenz attractor is an attractor that arises in a simplified system of equations. These set of equations were developed by Edward Lorenz to model a simplified weather system. The differential equations are as follows:
1. dx/dt = σ(y − x)

2.	dy/dt = rx − y − xz

3.	dz/dt = xy − bz

The system of differences equations describe 2-D flow of fluid of uniform depth, in other words the equations model the flow of fluid(usually air) from a hot area to a cold area. Where it is proportional to convective intensity,  is proportional to temperature differences between descending and ascending currents and  is prop to diff in vertical temp profile from linearity in the system of equations. 
The solution to the differential equations is a dynamical system aka the Lorenz attractor. The solution can be plotted with varying initial conditions.

-Chaos: aperiodic long-term behavior in a deterministic system that exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
	Jargon words= aperiodic: doesn’t repeat and doesn’t settle down to equilibrium
-Attractor (A): 
	properties: 
1.	invariant set: starts in A, stays in A
2.	Attracts an open set of initial set of conditions
3.	No proper subset of A satisfies 1) and 2)

The solutions to the set of three differential equations are derived using Euler’s method. Euler’s method is a simple and basic solution to ordinary differential equations(ODE). The idea is that a differential curve is broken into smaller segments to approximate values for solutions of ODE.
